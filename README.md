## Projects Overview

This repository is a collection of diverse game projects, showcasing my passion for game development. From simple arcade games to more complex simulations, each project offers a unique gaming experience. Explore the directories to learn more about the specific games I've created.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **T-rex game**: A clone of Chrome's "no internet" game that fully replicates all the functionality, graphics and gameplay of the original.
- **Guess a number game**
- **Hangman game**: The good old-fashioned Hangman game that we all know and love.
- ...

Feel free to dive into each game directory to find source code, assets, and documentation related to the respective game.

## How to Navigate

To explore a specific game project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
2. **Navigate to the Game's Directory**: Each game has its own directory. Move to the desired game directory to access project-specific information.
3. **Explore the Game**: Each game directory typically contains a README providing details about the game, source code, assets, and any other relevant resources.
